# The Preferences for Creativity Scale (PCS) 
This repository provides complementary files related to Preferences for Creativity (PCS) research project. This project investigates the factors that influence the creativity of the concept selection stage during design, and advances a psychometric scale for assessing designers's preferences for creativity. The resulting product is a 23-item psychometric scale that was developed by drawing on existing literature in the design and creativity spaces, and through validation across several studies.
